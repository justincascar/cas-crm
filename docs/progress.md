# Progress

## Environment (2026-09-15)

- Inspected `Code` folder: only the build brief was present. Created `CAS-CRM`.
- Earlier visual prototype at cas-claims-workspace.justin380018.chatgpt.site required ChatGPT sign-in; **source was not accessed**. Dashboard design is original.
- Installed Node.js 24.19.0 LTS via winget. Git was already present. Python was not installed and was not required.

## Stage 1 — working dashboard (in progress / first running version)

Implemented:

- Persistent SQLite store with 12 fictional TEST claims spanning new enquiry, roadworthy reservation without charges, undriveable recovery/hire, fault courtesy, liability/engineer waits, repair auth, repairs in progress, ready for return, total-loss payment/salvage, qualifying off-hire countdown, day-80 unsigned renewal, litigation/offer review.
- Dashboard counts that open filtered lists; search; claim create/edit; notes; tasks; fleet availability and overlap-blocked reservations.
- File history with dated steps (initial TP insurer letter, engineer instructed, repairs started, and related events). Letters generated from those dates. Email compose/incoming logging recorded on the file; sending is simulated until the office mailbox is connected.
- Hire Pack data collection and generation from the CAS Hire Pack.doc structure (hirer, additional driver, hire vehicle vs own vehicle, charges, mitigation, handover, cancellation notice). Signatures are not fabricated.
- Staff intake form covering client (owner/driver/owner/driver split), vehicle lookup, tax/MOT/insurance recording, damage, accident (maps link, police, witnesses, speeds), recovery charges, storage starting the same day as recovery, and up to three third parties with insurer and TPI agent fields.
- Claim file screens matching the current CRM viewing pane (client, hire, damage diagram, fleet reserve, recovery, storage, loss of use dates, financial summary). Values persist in SQLite. Opening a file or reserving a vehicle still does not start charges.
- Duplicate Alpha screens (navigation, hire-car register, extra-charges, loss-of-use dates as a second chronology) are hidden. Communications sit on the file: simulated send/receive email and WhatsApp, recorded calls, and letter generation from file dates.
- Simulated postcode and registration lookups, clearly labelled.
- Distinct claimed / offered / agreed / received totals.
- Tests in `tests/` for the behavioural rules in the brief that can be checked without live integrations.

Labelled simulated / not live: vehicle lookups, correspondence sending, document files, WhatsApp, email, e-sign, MID API.

Staff sign-in (17 September 2026): username/password for the four demonstration handlers, hashed in SQLite, HTTP-only session cookie, server-side checks on pages and actions. Still this PC only; all signed-in staff see every file. Credentials: `docs/AUTH-NOTES.md`.

Blocked: CAS templates, provider accounts, per-file permissions, shared hosting.

## Not yet claimed

Stages 2–5 (finer permissions, live integrations, payment packs from CAS templates, litigation issue, backups/restore/deploy). Working dashboard is not production readiness.
